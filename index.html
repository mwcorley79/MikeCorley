         <p>
            This site serves as portal into my software development interests: tools, blogs, teaching and code.
            My journey at Syracuse University began in Spring 2005, having taken courses in the Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Electical Engineering
            departments.  I'm fortunate to have met Dr. James Fawcett, under whom I completed the M.S. Computer Engineering degree in 2011.
            You can visit Dr. Fawcett's new github site: <a href="https://jimfawcett.github.io"> here. </a> I have roughly 20 years experience as a professional 
            software developer, having worked on numerious challenging research and devlopements projects for a variety of different DoD customers.
            Spring semester 2020 begins an exciting New Year and journey for me as I teach <a href="cse384.html">CSE 384 (Systems and Network Programming) </a> for the first time.     
         </p>    
         <p> 
             Update (September 2020): The EECS department was gracious enough to extend to me the opportunity to teach CSE 384 for a second time (Fall 2020)! However, I 
             opted to decline due to conflicts (changes) with my work schedule!  Thanks to all students, TAs, and to Dr. Fawcett who helped make this course a success and a great experience!
             I look forward to the possibility of the teaching in future semesters. Wishing everyone a great, and SAFE semester! Feel free to send me an email! <br><br>

                Background:
                <indent-block>
                    I graduated from <a href="https://www.sjfc.edu/"> St. John Fisher College </a> in May 2000 with
                    a B.S. in Computer Science.  In October 2000, I began my professional career
                    working as a computer programmer for a defense contracting firm supporting the mission(s)
                    of the <a href="https://www.wpafb.af.mil/afrl/ri/">Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).</a>

                    January 2005 marked the beginning of my M.S. course of study in Computer Engineering at Syracuse University.
                    In May 2011, after completing more than the 30 credit hour requirement, a project
                    and a series of the electrical engineering remedial courses (under the bridge program),
                    I was awarded the MSCE degree. It was at Syracuse in the Spring 2005 semester that I first met Dr. Fawcett.
                    Not only did I take all of his software courses, but due to the richness of the course content and the continual change 
                    in the technology landscape, I took several of his courses more than once: CSE681 - Software Modeling and
                    Analysis (twice), CSE687 - Object Oriented Design (four times), CSE 775 -
                    Distributed Objects (twice), and CSE686 - Internet Programming - (twice).
                    Perhaps nobody takes the same courses more than once(
                    <span style="font-style:italic"> especially not after earning an </span><span style="font-weight:bolder; font-family:Tahoma;"> A </span> the first time around)
                    My time spent with Dr. Fawcett has helped to shape the course of my career! Now that he is retired from teaching, I collaborate with him on projects and topics of mutual interest. 
                    Many thanks to Dr. Fawcett for sharing his knowledge and insights!

                    Over the past 19+ years I've worked for multiple large and small defense contracting firms.
                    Today, I am Senior Sofware Architect at Quanterion Solutions Inc, in Utica NY.  I spend as much
                    time as I can writing code! I really enjoy programming in C# (.Net Core), C/C++, and occasionaly Python.
                    In these pages you will find useful information on topics that I feel are important
                    for all software professionals. Thanks for visting!
